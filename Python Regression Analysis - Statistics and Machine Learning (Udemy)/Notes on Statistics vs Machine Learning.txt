> Major differences

    >> Statistics:
        >>> Subfield of Math
        >>> Focuses on forming relationship between variables in the form of equations
        >>> Confidence Intervals
        >>> Using variable relationships to predict outcomes
        >>> Quantify uncertainty

    >> Machine Learning:
        >>> Subfield of CS and AI
        >>> Algorithms that learn from data without relying on rules-based programming
        >>> Building systems than can learn from data
        >>> Prediction and classification is much more emphasized in machine learning

> Practical Differences

    >> Statistics:
        >>> Emphasizes formal statistical inference (Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis testing, estimators) in low dimensional problems
        >>> Choice of models is influenced by the underlying data
        >>> If formalized relationships exist between x and y, we can derive equations

    >> Machine Learning:
        >>> Emphasizes high dimensional prediction problems
        >>> Choice of models is based on predictive ability - NOT the data distribution (Results-based methods)
        >>> More amenable to non-linear / other types of complex or skewed data
        >>> Usually outputs NO equations

> Basic theories of Machine Learning

    >> They learn from data and do not seek to formalize the information
    >> The focus is on predictive modelling
    >> Supervised and Unsupervised

        >>> Unsupervised:
            + Draws inferences from data without labels
            + Groups (clusters) like-data
            + Works to find info about unstructured data with little to no interference from users

        >>> Supervised:
            + Requires user help to train the models (training data, references, etc...)
            + Classification (Categorical) and Regression (Continuous)
